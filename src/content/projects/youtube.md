As of the "publishing" date (aka, the date of last edit) I run a total of 3 YouTube channels, one as my main and two as extras for various reasons:

- [Grayvox](https://www.youtube.com/@Grayvox), my main channel.
- [Grayvox Live](https://www.youtube.com/@GrayvoxLive), my livestreaming and VODs channel.
- [Grayvox Rants](https://www.youtube.com/@GrayvoxRants), my off topic channel of rants.

## Grayvox

Grayvox, my main channel, is the one I consider to be my "front facing" one. I produce content surrounding design, development, writing and history of games. The way I do this is by creating videos that usually surround one game (or type/genre of game) and use them as a way to explain why I think they are well made and what can be learned from them. I don't want to only produce entertainment, I want to produce engaging content that viewers can walk away learning a bit from. For this, the audience I play into is usually those in writing and storytelling in some shape or form - though usually with video games.

On this channel, I also produce a number of series that get actively added to. These series include:

- **Random Game Ideas**: A short form video series where I talk through a random idea I had for a video game, ARG, or digital experience of some kind.
- **Hauntings of Itch**: A monthly series focused on 3 unsettling games I found and tried out, each with their own mini lecture attached on what my thoughts on the game were and what I think is important to take from for the purposes of learning to build your own stories.

## Grayvox Live

Grayvox Live, my livestreaming and VODs channel, is where I house all of my live-recorded content from YouTube and Twitch alike. This includes clips, edited lecture moments, and full stream VODs. Usually I stream live coding, video gaming, reactions to news about the state of tech and game dev, along with sporadic memes and lectures in between.

As of writing, I am only planning on streaming but have yet to make it happen. In case I (very likely) forgot to update this, check [the channel itself](https://www.youtube.com/@GrayvoxLive) or [my Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/grayvoxdev) to see if I've made it happen yet.

## Grayvox Rants

Grayvox Rants is my "other other" channel. It's sole purpose is to be a place where I can dump sporadic lectures of just me, OBS, and Excalidraw (Plus some minor editing so there isn't long spells of me trying to find my words). These lectures (rants?) could be anything from books to movies to gaming rigs to business talk - though any of these could be brought up on stream, this channel is where I put the off stream and longer rants.

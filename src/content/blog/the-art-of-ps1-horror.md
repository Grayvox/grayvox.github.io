Horror is something I always find myself getting into even if I haven't touched it in a while. The thrill, the fear, the sheer mystery of topics that would be classified as "horror" (More specifically true crime, murder, and such)... it's not hard to admit I enjoy the theme.

Horror is subjective though, in more than one way. Today, I wanted to talk about the part of it that seems to never know any bounds... the diversity in creations. Body horror, claustrophobia, scopaesthesia... all ways to get a scare out of someone, or at least unsettle them. But one part of horror that fasinates me most out of them all has to be PS1 horror: A strange and hard to explain niche that is ever abundant on platforms like Itch, where indie creators love to relive a time not so long ago filled with basic 3D models, retro graphics, and 8-bit style music... but with a fear factor. They don't even have to do much, really, to create an unsettling enviornment with these concepts. The question is, how?

## Some outside inspiration

I wasn't inspired to write this article out of nowhere. In fact, I owe it to a few people to spark this interest in writing something about it. So, to give credit where credit is due, here it goes:

- To Nexpo, for producing a [spectacular video on the concept behind PS1 horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAmQ5ODJJfA).
- To ENIGMA STUDIO, for creating [some inspiring retro horror games](https://enigma-studio.itch.io) that I dearly love.
- To DEVHOUR GAMES, for creating [Loveland](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432340/Loveland/), a game that hasn't even released yet (as of writing), but I'm so hyped up for.

And to everyone making games in this genre, keep at it. This community is under appreciated and has some insanely talented creators that are apart of it. Oh, and I _highly_ recommend you give Nexpo's video a watch after reading this. But enough prologue, let's get into it.

## Retro? VHS? PS1?
